# Denoising Diffusion

A learning path on the diffusion process and the models which carry it out.

Topics:
- Implementing standard and fast sampling algorithms.
- Neural network for noise prediction.
- Training a diffusion model.
- Adding context for personalized image generation.

Outcomes:
- Understand diffusion models in use today.
- Build a diffusion model from scratch and train it.

Also, you will get a model that can serve as a starting point for your own exploration of diffusion models for your applications.
